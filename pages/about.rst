Welcome to foodie.rsegebre.com, a place to talk share content about (1) recipes, (2) document any food experiences around Boston and neighboring areas, (3) figure out ways in which technology can innovate cooking and (4) criticize/try-out recipes that I find online and see how feasable they are.

This will get updated later on with more details... For the time being this will have some of my to-do tasks for this website.

TODO:
* Fix tiptue searching
* Generate sitemap
* Create Pages for each of the 4 purposes of this website
* Figure out the best way to include images in recipes.

If you have any questons feel free to use the comment box below.
