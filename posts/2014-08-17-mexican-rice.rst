Serves: 2 people

Ingredients:
============
* 1 cup Long grain rice
* 1/3 cup diced Onion ( ~1/2 a small onion )
* 1/3 cup minced garlic ( ~4-5 garlic cloves )
* 1 cup of water or broth of choice
* 1 cup of a can of crushed tomatoes (or any not-too-thick salsa you have around) 
* Frozen veggies to taste
* 4 tablespoons of vegetable/canola/corn oil.
* Salt/pepper/turmeric/paprika

Preparation:
=============
1. Dice the onion
2. Mince the garlic
3. Warm up the salsa

Cooking Instructions:
======================
In a medium size pan at low-medium heat, put a couple tablespoons of oil and add the onion and garlic. Saut√© until it starts getting translucent, meanwhile add salt, pepper and paprika to taste. And two pinches of turmeric. Then add another two tablespoons of oil, and add the dry rice (no need to rinse it). Stir until the rice starts getting a bit translucent. Then add the 1 cup of salsa and 1 cup of broth, stir and turn up heat to medium. Once it starts to simmer, lay frozen veggies of choice on the top. Finally, put a lid on the pan and set heat to low. Cook for 13-15 minutes or until rice is fluffy.

Note(s):
========
I think of this is a side dish, so I usually have it with some chicken fillets, or any other protein. To plate it a just serve it on a side, slice half an avocado and lay it on top of the rice with a bit of your favorite salsa on top.
