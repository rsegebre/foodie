Ingredients:
============
* 2 lbs of Round Bone Cut Beef
* Baby Corn
* Yellow Corn
* 2-4 Carrots
* Potatoes
* 1 Small Whole Green Cabbage
* Green Beans
* Cilantro
* Onions
* Zucchini
* Yucca (optional)
* Beets (optional)
* Beef Broth (optional)

Preparation:
============
1. Start by boiling 6 cups of water. Then put some salt and pepper on the Round Bone Cut Beef, and put into the boiling water. Add a bit of cilantro, a dash of cumin, and some salt and pepper. Reduce to a simmer and allow to cook for 2-4 hours, depending on how strong the broth turns out. If you have a pressure cooker, the meat will turn more tender faster and you will have a better broth, but don’t worry if you don’t.
2. Clean the whole kernel and cut in 2 inch chunks.
3. Cut the carrots in 1/2 inch quarters ( cut vertically into 4 parts then cut into 1/2 chunks ).
4. Clean the potatoes and cut into medium sized chunks ( about 1 in by 2 in chunks )
5. Cut the zucchini into 1/2 inch quarters just like the carrots.
6. Peel the yucca and cut like the potatoes.
7. Dice the onion in chunks.
8. Cut the cabbage into eight chunks.
9. Cut the baby corn in halves, horizontally.

Cooking Instructions:
======================
Once the beef is easilly separate by a fork, stop cooking it ( about 2-3 hours). On a separate pot big enough to contain all the vegetables, pour a cup of water in it and start boiling it. If you are using the yucca add the yucca and corn first and allow to boil for 20 minutes. Then pour the broth you had prepared into the big pot. Then add the potatoes, carrot, cabbage, onions, baby corn (if it is not pre-cooked) and the round Bone Cut beef from the pot with the broth. Now, simmer for another 20 minutes with the lid. Then proceed to add the remaining ingredients, cilantro, green beans and zuchinni. Then simmer for 30 minutes with the lid. You should simmer this until the yucca is tender to the fork, potatoes are ready, whole corn is ready. Make sure you taste and adjust seasoning, I like to test for seasoning as I go, since every round of introducing new vegetables the broth might get sweeter, richer from all the flavor released by the vegetables. I also always ended up making a weak broth, so I ended up using those cube beef broths.

Note(s):
========
I usually boil a couple of whole peeled beets separately, and cut into slices, so you can add to the soup as you serve it. That and you must have this with some turmeric, thin noodles, slightly salted long grain rice. I will be writing the recipe for this later.
